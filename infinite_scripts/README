The login script does the following:

1) Log in as Stephen Freiberg
2) Search the Enron Email source for free text "enron"
3) Get the information about the user Stephen Freiberg
4) Log out.


All response data is appended to the file "response.txt".

Brian - if you want to get sentiment data:
$ cat response.txt | grep -i "sentiment"

that will give you a little to work with.
