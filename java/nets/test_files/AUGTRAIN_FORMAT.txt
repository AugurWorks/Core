- lc is the learning constant
- mtr is minimum number of training rounds
- cutoff is cutoff performance to stop training (0.1 is good, 0 is perfect)
- n is the number of inputs
- d is the depth of the network
- x iterations per row
- y iterations of file
- i is a double input value
- et is expected value of test number t
